# YOLO_Drowsiness_Detection
A Drowsiness Detection Model That I Trained By My Images
This project uses a custom YOLOv5 model for object detection.
The model was trained using YOLOv5, and images were labeled with LabelImg.
The project also relies on PyTorch for deep learning computations.
### Note:
The testing image (`sleepyman.jpg`) is not of me, so the model's accuracy may be lower than expected.
## Requirements

For droswsiness detection part, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
